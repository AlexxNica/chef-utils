These cookbooks are provide as examples to go along with our public talks.

While they are provided under the Apache license, and you are free to use them,
they were not originally designed for generic use and may have assumptions in
them that don't work for everyone.

We hope that they provide a useful example for the way in which we write
data-driven cookbooks.

NOTE: Because ordering of attribute-file loading is highly variable on many
factors, our model specifically assumes a cookbook attribute file only touches
it's own data (defaults for it's exported API), and that all users of that API
will touch that data in recipes.
