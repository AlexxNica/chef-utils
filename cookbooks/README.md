These cookbooks are provide as examples to go along with our public talks.

While they are provided under the Apache license, and you are free to use them,
they were not originally designed for generic use and may have assumptions in
them they don't work for everyone.

We hope that they provide a useful example for the way in which we write
data-driven cookbooks.

NOTE: Because Facebook still uses Chef 10 clients, READMEs refer to specifing
attributes in recipe files. In Chef 11 it is more preferrably to do so in an
attributes file provide that cookbook is later in the runlist.
